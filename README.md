# Blockchain Message Encoder

A simple utility that encodes arbitrary messages into valid Bitcoin addresses and sends a minimal amount of BTC to these addresses, in order.

Messages can be found and decoded by providing the source address from which they were created.

**This is a minimal proof-of-concept that was tested only on the testnet. Use with real funds at your own risk.
The blockchain and this utility are publicly accessible. Do not use this utility with the expectation of privacy.**
